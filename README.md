# Iris-Classification
The iris flower, scientifically known as Iris, is a distinctive genus of flowering plants. Within this genus, there are three primary species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. These species exhibit variations in their physical characteristics, particularly in the measurements of their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Objective: 
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of learning from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classifying them into their respective species.
The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a classification model that can accurately identify the species of iris flowers based on their measurements.

# Conclusion:
Used multiple ML models to check the accuracy of the predicition. Logistic Regression gives the highest accuracy for the classiifcation of the Iris flower in this project.
